                Hi, my name is Hoang Quoc Ly. I'm a sophomore studying 
                computer science and data science at University of 
                Masachusetts at Amherst. 
                <br/><br/>
                My main interest is about artificial intelligence and its branches 
                (machine learning, deep learning, etc.). I want to 
                especially learn more about the use of artificial intelligence in 
                medical fields.
                <br/><br/>
                At the moment, I'm taking a break from artificial intelligence 
                and learning more about web/app development. This web portfolio
                 is my first project using react.
